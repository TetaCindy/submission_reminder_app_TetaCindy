This readme file is to explain how to run this application:

       CREATE_ENVIRONMENT.SH
To set up the application, open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the create_environment.sh is located. 	To do this
you will have to clone the repository using "git clone repositorylink" and then change directory. Then run the script using "bash
create-environment.sh" Then Enter.
The script will prompt you to enter your name and this will automatically create the directory will all the required files. Once 
this is done, then run the startup.sh script that is inside the directory that was created. After running, the application will 
then tell you the students that have yet to submit the shell navigation assignment.

     COPILOT_SHELL_SCRIPT
Firstly, make sure you are in the right directory, then to run the copilot_shell_script.sh use " bash copilot_shell_script.sh"
then it will prompt you to write a new assignment name you want to track then after running it it will then tell you the number of
 students who are yet to  submit the assignmet you have entered.
